The Musical Speech Isolation and Conversion Automation Project

## Motivation
This project is inspired by my personal interests in language, the topic of translation and my desire to improve my engineering skills. The motivation for this project is to explore speech recognition techniques that are relevant to translation technology and to become familiar with topics including linguistics, feature extraction, and machine learning. This project is structured as part of the Applied Leadership / Learning Experience (ALE) in the Presidents Leadership Class at the University of Colorado in Boulder. For this project, I chose to use musical context for speech recognition because it is less common and introduces unique speech patterns and additional auditory features.

My learning goals for this project can be categorized as broad topic goals, technical skills goals, and experience goals. As mentioned above, my topic goals are to become familiar and gain a base understanding of linguistics, feature extraction and machine learning. I will also explore concepts within the topics of vocal isolation, developing language models, and speech recognition. My technical skills goals are to become proficient in C++ programming, the linux operating system, and to develop skills in signal processing for extracting information from audio data. My experience goals include embracing active learning, pushing my comfort zone, and developing strong reflection habits.
